# Tiny Chatbot

A simple, fun, and lightweight **Tiny Chatbot** that responds to user input with pre-defined or random replies.  
Built in pure Python under **100 lines of code** as part of **Hacktoberfest 2025**.  

## Features
- Responds to greetings, questions, jokes, and goodbyes.
- Returns **randomized replies** for a more natural feel.
- Includes a simple **typing animation** for better UX.
- Handles unknown inputs gracefully with default responses.
- Works entirely in the **terminal — no external libraries** needed.
